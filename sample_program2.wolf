`
Example using map (.) and lambda (\).
This program takes a list and modifies the list to contain
the factorials of its original contents
`
?factorial(n) := =(n, 0) : @1 ; @ *(n, factorial(-(n, 1)))
`
returns a list such that each element n becomes n!
For example, the list [0,3,1,5] becomes [1,6,1,120]
`
.(\(element -> factorial(element)), list)
