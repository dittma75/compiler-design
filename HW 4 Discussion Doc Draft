When creating this parser, we an issue with LL(k). 
Our old grammar was technically LL(infinity). Our grammar had
to be adjusted in order to make it at most LL(1 or 2).  One unsolved problem with our Parser 
is displaying which tokens are expected. The parser can tell you an invalid Token, 
but it doesnâ€™t know which token(s) should be there. For example (identifier], the parser
would tell you that ] is invalid, but not tell you to use ).
