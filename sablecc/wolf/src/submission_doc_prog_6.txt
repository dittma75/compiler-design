  In order to implement a parser using SableCC, several files needed to be
changed. Our grammar file, wolf.grammar, was updated to work with SableCC.
Lambda functions were also added to our grammar and work successfully with
the parser. Another sample program was added in order to ensure that all the
features of our language were being tested.
  We experienced several difficulties during this assignment. Sample program 1,
first created in the lexer phase, was syntactically wrong with some of the
updated grammar rules, and needed to be fixed accordingly. The grammar
was slightly changed in order to work with SableCC as well.
