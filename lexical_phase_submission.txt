    Our programming language is currently named WOLF.  It is a free-form,
functional programming language that ignores all whitespace characters and
comments.  Comments are identified as all characters between a pair of
backtick (`) characters.  Since it is a functional language, the language uses
predefined and user-defined functions as the basis for programs written in
WOLF.  The assignment statement binds a function definition to a name rather
than a value to a name.  Hence, a program written in WOLF is a list of
function definitions and then a function call.  This function call could be
composed with other functions.
